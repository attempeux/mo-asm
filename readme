    -*- About -*-
    Morse encoder and decoder written in x86_64 assembly using AT&T syntax, therefore assembly
    with `as` assembler, there is a makefile anyway.

    -*- Run it -*-
    cd src/
    make
    ./moasm [MODE] "[message]"

    Mode can be either M or T, M goes from morse to text and T makes the opposite; if T mode
    is used then, it will only print alphabetic characters aka [a-zA-Z] other ones will print as
    they are.
