    -*- About -*-
    Morse encoder and decoder written in x86_64 assembly using AT&T syntax, therefore assembly
    with `as` assembler, there is a makefile anyway.

    -*- Run it -*-
    cd src/
    make
    ./moasm [MODE] "[message]"

    Mode can be either M or T, M goes from morse to text and T makes the opposite operation;
    if T mode is selected, it will only print alphabetic characters ([a-zA-Z]) in its morse
    version; other character will be printed without conversion.
